# ChattyBot
Author: Shreya Chitturi

## Project Description
A chatbot created from scratch in Python that allows a user to have a conversation with a bot. The bot is able to answer a variety of the user's questions such as "what is your
name?", "what is today's date?, "how are you", etc. The bot answers the user's questions by looking at keywords in the question and then looking up those keywords in a 
dictionary of possible questions. The bot engages the user by  asking them questions to answer in return. Once the user wants to quit the program, they can type in "quit", 
"exit", or "bye".
